    <p> 
        Adults are strikingly tri-colored, with a black back and tail and a red head and neck. Their underparts are mainly white. The wings are black with white secondary remiges. Adult males and females are identical in plumage.Juveniles have very similar markings, but have an all grey head.
        <br><br>
        While red-bellied woodpeckers have some bright red on the backs of their necks and heads, red-headed woodpeckers have a much deeper red that covers their entire heads and necks, as well as a dramatically different overall plumage pattern.
        <br><br>
       These are mid-sized woodpeckers. Both sexes measure from 7.5 to 9.8 in in length, with a wingspan of 16.7 in. They weigh from 2.0 to 3.4 oz with an average of 2.7 oz. Each wing measures 5.0–5.9 in, the tail measures 2.6–3.3 in, the bill measures 0.83–1.18 in and the tarsus measures 0.75–0.98 in. The maximum longevity in the wild is 9.9 years.

    <h2 id="taxonomy"> Taxonomy</h2>
  <p>The red-headed woodpecker was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work Systema Naturae. Red headed woodpeckers belong to the Animalia Kingdom. Their class is Aves. The order they belong to is Piciformes. Their family is Picidae. Their species is Malanerpes Erythocephalus.
       <br> <br>
      The red-headed woodpecker was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work Systema Naturae.[3] The specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words ἐρυθρός, erythros 'red' and κεφαλή, kephalē 'head'.
There are three subspecies recognized:
<br>
M. e. brodkorbi
      <br>
M. e. caurinus
      <br>
M. e. erythrocephalus

    <h2 id="habitat"> Habitat</h2>
    <p> Red-headed woodpeckers are widely distributed throughout most of North America. They range east to west from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and north to south from Lake Winnipeg and southern Ontario, to Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, and Florida. This bird was once common, but is now found only in patches throughout its range. 
They live in Eastern and central North America, in open woodlands, forest clearings, river bottoms, orchards, and parks. This woodpecker especially likes areas with dead or dying trees.
        <br><br>
        They nest in a cavity in a dead tree, utility pole, or a dead part of a tree that is between 8.0 and 80.4 ft above the ground. They lay 4 to 7 eggs in early May which are incubated for two weeks. Two broods can be raised in a single nesting season. Northern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range, with most having arrived on the breeding range by late April, and having left for winter quarters by late October;[10][11] southern birds are often permanent residents.</p>

    <p>These are small to medium-sized woodpecker. They are tri-colored with a black back and tail with a red head and neck and a white stomach area. They measure from 7.5-9 inches in length with a wingspan of 16.7 inches.  Their average weight is 2.7 ounces. They are strong fliers. Juveniles have brownish heads and upperparts, with blackish bars and brown streaking.
        <br> <br>
        
        Red-headed woodpeckers are sexually monomorphic. This means that males and females look exactly the same. They have bright red heads, necks, throats and shoulders. Their wings and tail are bluish-black. They have a white belly and a large square area of white on their rump. Their bills are long and chisel shaped, which is important for drilling into trees. Young red-headed woodpeckers look similar to adults, but their heads and necks are buffy-brown instead of red.
<br> <br>
Red-headed woodpeckers are small compared to other woodpeckers. They are 21 to 25 cm long and have a wingspan of 33 to 37 cm. They weigh about 70 grams.</p>

<h2 id="diet"> Diet</h2>
    <p>These birds are omnivorous. They fly to catch insects in the air or on the ground, forage on trees or gather and store nuts. They enjoy insects, spiders, earthworms, nuts, seeds, berries, and fruit. The red-headed woodpecker doesn’t drill into trees to excavate insects as often as other woodpeckers. 
<br><br>
They perch on a tree branch and wait for flying prey to go by. They are surprisingly inconspicuous birds for being so flashy in color. Red-headed woodpeckers search for food in many different ways. They hunt for flying insects by perching on branches and watching for the insects, then chasing after them. 
<br><br>
They search for other foods on the ground, or in shrubs. Most woodpeckers drill into wood to find their food. Red-headed woodpeckers do drill into wood to look for food, but they spend more time hunting flying insects.</p>

    <p>
These birds will occasionally visit backyard birdfeeders in the winter. They like corn, pecans, fruit, and acorns. They do not drill in trees like other woodpeckers, but you will occasionally see them in the area.
        <br> <br>
        Red-headed woodpeckers are solitary. They defend a territory year-round.
<br> <br>
Red-headed woodpeckers spend most of their time looking for food. In autumn, these woodpeckers store food for the winter. They store nuts and insects by pushing into cracks and holes in trees or other wooden objects, such as fence posts.
<br> <br>
Most red-headed woodpeckers live in the same area year-round. The red-headed woodpeckers that breed in the northern and western parts of the range migrate south in the fall. Red-headed woodpeckers migrate during the day. They usually fly short distances at a time.
        <br> <br>
        Red-headed woodpeckers sometimes feed on cultivated fruits and vegetables. This can cost small farmers.
        <br> <br>
        This bird is a favorite of birdwatchers and thus provides recreational value to humans.</p>
