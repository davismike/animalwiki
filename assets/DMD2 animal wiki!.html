    <h1>Red-Headed Woodpecker</h1>
    
    <h2> Description</h2>
<br>
    <p> 
        Red headed woodpeckers can be found throughout the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. They are beautiful bird with crimson heads, black backs, and white stomachs. They are very social and are found in family groups. These birds are often seen finding nuts and sitting on snags to catch insects. 
        <br><br>
        Adults are strikingly tri-colored, with a black back and tail and a red head and neck. Their underparts are mainly white. The wings are black with white secondary remiges. Adult males and females are identical in plumage. 
        <br> <br>
        Juveniles have very similar markings, but have an all grey head. While red-bellied woodpeckers have some bright red on the backs of their necks and heads, red-headed woodpeckers have a much deeper red that covers their entire heads and necks, as well as a dramatically different overall plumage pattern. </p>

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p> Red-headed woodpeckers are widely distributed throughout most of North America. They range east to west from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and north to south from Lake Winnipeg and southern Ontario, to Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, and Florida. This bird was once common, but is now found only in patches throughout its range. 
They live in Eastern and central North America, in open woodlands, forest clearings, river bottoms, orchards, and parks. This woodpecker especially likes areas with dead or dying trees.</p>

    <p>These birds are omnivorous. They enjoy insects, spiders, earthworms, nuts, seeds, berries, and fruit. The red-headed woodpecker doesnâ€™t drill into trees to excavate insects as often as other woodpeckers. 
<br><br>
They perch on a tree branch and wait for flying prey to go by. They are surprisingly inconspicuous birds for being so flashy in color. Red-headed woodpeckers search for food in many different ways. They hunt for flying insects by perching on branches and watching for the insects, then chasing after them. 
<br><br>
They search for other foods on the ground, or in shrubs. Most woodpeckers drill into wood to find their food. Red-headed woodpeckers do drill into wood to look for food, but they spend more time hunting flying insects.</p>
